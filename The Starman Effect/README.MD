I recently had an epiphany that changed the way I look at Video Game Music creation, and it all starts with the Super Star theme from Super Mario.

The Starman theme is a classic and everyone remembers it, and that's what makes it so... Morphable. Check this out.

You can add more instruments to give it more depth to the track, and because it's so simple, it works so well.
Nintendo did this a lot, with every Mario game, they added more to the theme.
Adding bongos, melodic polyphony, until they completely remixed it in Super Mario World, and TWICE again in Super Mario 64.
It's kind of a cheat code for giving your game a musical identity. Just come up with a simple, catchy tune, and then it's easy to build off of.
You can change pitch, tempo, instruments, you can even adapt the instruments and rhythm to fit different scenarios.
You could make notes linger for a more dreamy and floaty sound,
or add Steccato to make it sound more abrasive, or METALLIC!

I call it the Starman Effect, and it all started with Square and Triangle.
